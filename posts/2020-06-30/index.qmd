"Misirlou" (Greek: Μισιρλού \< Turkish: Mısırlı 'Egyptian' \< Arabic:
مصر‎ Miṣr 'Egypt'\[1\]) is a folk song\[2\] from the Eastern
Mediterranean region, with origins in the Ottoman Empire. The original
author of the song is not known, but Arabic, Greek and Jewish musicians
were playing it by the 1920s. The earliest known recording of the song
is a 1927 Greek rebetiko/tsifteteli composition influenced by Middle
Eastern music. There are also Arabic belly dancing, Armenian, Persian,
Indian and Turkish versions of the song. This song was popular from the
1920s onwards in the Arab American, Armenian American and Greek American
communities who settled in the United States as part of the Ottoman
diaspora.

The song was a hit in 1946 for Jan August, an American pianist and
xylophonist nicknamed "the one-man piano duet". It gained worldwide
popularity through Dick Dale's 1962 American surf rock version,
originally titled "Miserlou", which popularized the song in Western
popular culture; Dale's version was influenced by an earlier Arabic folk
version played with an oud. Various versions have since been recorded,
mostly based on Dale's version, including other surf and rock versions
by bands such as the Beach Boys, the Ventures, Consider the Source, and
the Trashmen, as well as international orchestral easy listening
(exotica) versions by musicians such as Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman.
Dale's surf rock version later gained renewed popularity when director
Quentin Tarantino used it in his 1994 film Pulp Fiction, and again when
it was sampled in the Black Eyed Peas' song "Pump It" (2006).

# **Name**

Misirlou (Μισιρλού), due to the suffix "ou", is the feminine form (in
Greek\[3\]) of Misirlis (Μισιρλής- a surname) which comes from the
Turkish word Mısırlı, which is formed by combining Mısır ("Egypt" in
Turkish, borrowed from Arabic مِصر‎ Miṣr) with the Turkish -lı suffix,
literally meaning "Egyptian". Therefore, the song is about an Egyptian
woman.

# **Composition**

The folk song has origins in the Eastern Mediterranean region of the
Ottoman Empire, but the original author of the song is not known. There
is evidence that the folk song was known to Arabic musicians, Greek
rebetiko musicians and Jewish klezmer musicians by the 1920s.\[4\] The
claim in some sources that the tune derives from the song "Bint Misr"
("Egyptian Girl") written by Egyptian musician Sayed Darwish is thought
to be incorrect.\[5\]

The earliest known recording of the song was by the rebetiko musician
Theodotos ("Tetos") Demetriades (Greek: Θεόδοτος ("Τέτος") Δημητριάδης)
in 1927. Demetriades, an Ottoman Greek, was born in Istanbul, Ottoman
Empire, in 1897, and he resided there until he moved to the United
States in 1921,\[6\] during a period when most of the Greek speaking
population fled the emerging Turkish state. It is likely that he was
familiar with the song as a folk song before he moved to the United
States. As with almost all early rebetika songs (a style that originated
with the Greek refugees from Asia Minor in Turkey), the song's actual
composer has never been identified, and its ownership rested with the
band leader. Demetriades named the song "Misirlou" in his original 1927
Columbia recording, which is a Greek assimilated borrowing of the
regional pronunciation of "Egyptian" in Turkish ("Mısırlı"), as opposed
to the corresponding word for "Egyptian" in Greek, which is Αιγύπτιοι
(Aigyptioi).

The rebetiko version of the song was intended for a Greek tsifteteli
dance, at a slower tempo and a different key than the Oriental
performances that most are familiar with today. This was the style of
recording by Michalis Patrinos in Greece, circa 1930, which was
circulated in the United States by the Orthophonic label; another
recording was made by Patrinos in New York City in 1931 as well.

The song's Oriental melody has been so popular for so long that many
people, from Morocco to Iraq, claim it to be a folk song from their own
country. In the realm of Middle Eastern music, the song is a very simple
one, since it is little more than going up and down the Hijaz Kar or
double harmonic scale (E-F-G#-A-B-C-D#). It still remains a well known
Greek, Klezmer and Arab folk song.
