<strong>C Lydian</strong> is the fourth mode of the G major scale C Lydian Scale Notes: C D E F# G A B Lydian Scale Formula: 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7 Lydian Scale Intervals: W W W H W W H

The Ionian Mode is the first mode of the major scale. They are essentially the same scale. <strong>C Ionian</strong> Scale Notes: C D E F G A B Ionian Scale Formula: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Ionian Scale Intervals: W W H W W W H

<strong>Mnemonic:</strong> I Don't Play Loud Music After Lectures

I: WWHWWWH D:   WHWWWHW P:       HWWWHWW L:          WWWHWWH M:            WWHWWHW A:                WHWWHWW L:                    HWWHWWW

<strong>To Identify By Scale:</strong> Each mode corresponds to a scale degree of the major scale as follows (using the C Major Scale):

C - C, Ionian D - D, Dorian E - E, Phrygian F - F, Lydian G - G, Mixolydian A - A, Aeolian B - B, Locrian

<strong>To Identify by Pitch:</strong> Isolate two things - the tonic and the altered pitch. There are only five cases where a mode will present itself by key.

If your tonic is Major, there are only two possible modes:

Case 1: "The 4th scale degree is raised." You're in Lydian. Case 2: "The 7th scale degree is lowered." You're in Mixolydian.

If your tonic is Minor, there are only two possible modes:

Case 1: "The 6th scale degree is raised." You're in Dorian. Case 2: "The 2nd scale degree is lowered." You're in Phrygian. If none of these cases add up, you're likely in some form of the Locrian mode, but we more often use a diminished scale. This is the most unusual case, so if you're asked what mode you're in and none of the above cases present themselves to you, it's a good bet it's Locrian.

<strong>Examples from personal opinions:</strong>

LYDIAN Joe Satriani: Flying in a Blue Dream Dream Theater: Strange Deja Vu Beatles: Blue Jay Way (lydian elements only)

MIXOLYDIAN Traditional: She Moved Through the Fair Traditional: Blackwaterside Beatles: Tomorrow Never Knows Beatles: She Said She Said Steve Earle: Copperhead Road Them (etc): Gloria Television: Marquee Moon Rolling Stones: The Last Time Beatles: Within You Without You (aeolian deviation in bridge) Countless rock songs employ mixolydian verses with major key choruses or bridges. Examples: Beatles - A Hard Days Night (and many others); G'nR - Sweet Child O'Mine; Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil. The Beatles' Day Tripper is essentially a bunch of different mixolydian chords.

DORIAN Traditional: Scarborough Fair Traditional: What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor Miles Davis: So What John Coltrane: Impressions Tito Puente / Santana: Oye Como Va Herbie Hancock: Maiden Voyage \[but is it? see below\] Allman Brothers Band: In Memory of Elizabeth Reed Association: Along Comes Mary Michael Jackson: Thriller (mostly) Beatles: Love You To Lady Gaga: Telephone Manic Street Preachers: Small Black Flowers that Grow in the Sky (mostly)

AEOLIAN Bob Dylan / Jimi Hendrix: All Along the Watchtower Kate Bush: Running Up That Hill Rolling Stones: Gimme Shelter Sade: Smooth Operator (except for intro) Nirvana: Smells Like Teen Spirit (vocal melody)

PHRYGIAN Pink Floyd: Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun Montell Jordan: This is How We Do It Kanye West: Clique Slade: Cuz I Love You Metallica: Wherever I May Roam (riff) Clash: London Calling (partly) Dr Who theme (partly) Jefferson Airplane: White Rabbit (phrygian dominant?)

LOCRIAN John Kirkpatrick: Dust to Dust

### Interesting mixtures or partially modal tunes

Miles Davis: All Blues - mixolydian to dorian, with minor blues turnaround

Beatles: Eleanor Rigby - dorian and aeolian

Beatles: Norwegian Wood - mixolydian to dorian, with major key ii-V turnaround

Freddie Hubbard: Little Sunflower - mostly dorian, shifting to lydian or major.

Van Morrison: Moondance - dorian verse and chorus, minor key pre-chorus

Doors: Riders on the Storm - dorian vamp

Doors: Light My Fire - dorian keyboard solo

Strokes: Juicebox - locrian riff
