INTRO
    Am

VERSE
    Am
    Hey little apple blossom
         Dm
    What... seems to be the problem
    Am
    ...All the ones you tell your troubles to
         E            G        Am
    They don't really care for you
VERSE
    Am
    ...Come and tell me what you're thinking
           Dm
    Cause just when the boat is sinking
    Am
    ...A little light is blinking
        E               G      Am
    And I will come and rescue you

REFRAIN
        Dm                     Am
        ...Lots of girls walk around in tears
        E                      Am
        But that's not for you...
        Dm                          Am
        ...You've been looking all around for years
                B (let ring)                    E  G
        For someone to tell your troubles to
VERSE
    Am
    ...Come and sit with me and talk awhile
    Dm
    ...Let me see your pretty little smile
    Am
    ...Put your troubles in a little pile
        E                G       Am
    And I will sort them out for you

SOLO
        Dm                     Am
        ...Lots of girls walk around in tears
        E                      Am
        But that's not for you...
        Dm                          Am
        ...You've been looking all around for years
                B (let ring)                    E  G
        For someone to tell your troubles to
VERSE
    Am
    ...Come and sit with me and talk awhile
    Dm
    ...Let me see your pretty little smile
    Am
    ...Put your troubles in a little pile
        E                G       Am
    And I will sort them out for you
OUTRO
    E               G           Am
    ...I'll fall in love with you...
    E               G         Am
    ...I think I'll marry you
