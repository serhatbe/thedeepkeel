Practice with discipline, but without friction, maintaining a calm and steady approach. Take each step deliberately to enter the flow state where progress unfolds. Though progress is not the goal, it arises as a consequence of unintended outcomes. This is the ultimate state of mind, the one that brings true contentment.

**Warm-up (5–7 min)** - Finger stretch: 5–7–9–12 on low E and A strings. - Strum open chords (G, C, D, A) gently. - With metronome at **40 bpm**: strum muted strings once per click.

**Focus (20 min)** - Bar chords (maj/min) through cycle of fourths on low E string. - Strum once, let ring, then move calmly to the next chord.

**Secondary (15 min)** - Hybrid picking: Dsus4 → D → Dsus2 (very slow).

**Improvisation (7–10 min)** - Soft comping with bar chords, free time.

**Cooldown (3–5 min)** - Play favorite open chords slowly, with breath.

**Focus** - Hybrid picking arpeggiation on Dsus4 → D → Dsus2. - Add metronome at **50 bpm**: change chord every 2 clicks.

**Secondary** - Cycle of fourths (maj/min bar chords, light touch).

**Cooldown** - Slow strum Am chord.

## Day 6 – Blues Shuffle (Expansion)

**Warm-up** - Play open A pentatonic scale slowly. - Palm-muted downstrokes on open A.

**Focus** - Shuffle in A with turnaround (E7–D7–A7). - Metronome at **60 bpm**: only for first 4 bars, then stop.

**Secondary** - Hybrid picking on Dsus shapes.

**Improvisation** - Call-and-response fills between shuffle rhythm and tiny licks.

**Cooldown** - Free play blues fills softly.

## Day 7 – Integration + Simulated Performance

### **Pre-Performance Ritual (5 min)**

**1. Grounding Breath (Hand Method)** - Place one hand on your belly, optional other hand on chest.\

-   **Inhale 4 counts:** feel your belly rise.\
-   **Hold 2 counts:** keep hands steady, relax shoulders.\
-   **Exhale 6 counts:** feel your belly fall, optional chest lowers.\
-   Repeat 3–4 rounds.\
-   Mental cue: *“Calm and steady. Steps taken slowly.”*

**2. Gentle Touch** - Rest left hand lightly on fretboard, right hand on strings.\

-   No pressure, just feel the guitar. (*“Without friction.”*)

**3. Open String Meditation** - Play a single open string (e.g., A or D), let it ring fully.\

-   Repeat a few times. (*“Steps taken slowly.”*)

**4. Intentional First Notes** - Play one simple chord or phrase (e.g., Em or Dsus4).\

-   Focus on tone, not speed. (*“Progress unfolds.”*)

**5. Mental Cue** - Remind yourself: *“This is practice, not performance. Mistakes are outcomes, not failures.”*

### **Warm-up (5–7 min)**

-   Finger roll across fretboard (low E → high E → back).\
-   Strum G–C–D–A slowly, lightly tapping foot.\
-   Metronome at 40–50 bpm, one note/chord per click.

### **Integration “Set” (25–30 min)**

1.  Bar chords through cycle of fourths.\
2.  Dsus4 → D → Dsus2 hybrid arpeggios.\
3.  Blues shuffle in A with turnaround.\

-   Play continuously, **no stopping** for mistakes.

### **Simulated Performance (10–12 min)**

-   Record the full set straight through.\
-   Treat it like a real performance: start with breath, finish with a small bow or smile.
